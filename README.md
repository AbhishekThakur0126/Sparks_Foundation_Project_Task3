Problem Statement
The goal of this project was to conduct a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the 'SampleSuperstore' dataset, aiming to uncover insights that could assist a business manager in identifying weak areas and enhancing profitability. This analysis delved into order records to unveil trends, patterns, and factors that impact business operations and profits.


In this task, we will perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’. As a business manager, we will try to find out the weak areas where we can work to make more profit. Also, what all business problems can be derived by exploring the data.

# Feedback/Suggestion

-> Profits and sales are highly correlated.

-> There is no correlation among quantity and profit.

-> States like Texas, Ohio has huge sales but it makes big loss. So, there is need to reduce the sales in these states.

-> States like Michigan, Indiana, Virginia, Georgia makes good profit. So, sales can be increased in these states

-> In Category, Furniture has large number of sales, instead of making profit, it makes loss. So, there is need to limit the sales of Furniture.
